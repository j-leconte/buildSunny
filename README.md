Python source code, database file (.sqlite) and graphic interface file (.ui)

You can replace the .py file by an executable to avoid having to install python and the libraries

(Exe available here : https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JulKzV_laHxMbzx4xJQq-IA_SAzD21bX)

Just need to place the sqlite, ui, and either the py or exe file in the same directory and execute it
