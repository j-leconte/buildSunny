Description and wild pokemons generator from database

Python source code, database file (.sqlite) and graphic interface file (.ui)
You can replace the .py file by an executable to avoid having to download python libraries
(Exe available here : https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JulKzV_laHxMbzx4xJQq-IA_SAzD21bX)

Just need to place the sqlite, ui, and either the py or exe file in the same directory and execute it !
